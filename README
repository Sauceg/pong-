### 1. Pygame Initialization and Setup
- Pygame modules are initialized, a display window is created, and the title of the window is set.
- The `main()` function initializes the game, creates a `Game` object, and starts the main game loop.

### 2. `Game` Class
- Represents the main game object.
- Manages game-specific attributes such as paddle, ball, score, and game state.
- The `play()` method is the main game loop where events are handled, the game is drawn, and updates are made.
- `handle_events()` method handles user events such as key presses.
- `handle_key_down()` and `handle_key_up()` methods handle key presses and releases, respectively.
- `draw()` method draws all game objects, including paddles, ball, and scores.
- `update()` method updates the game state, including paddle movement, ball movement, and score.
- `decide_continue()` method checks if the game should continue based on the score.

### 3. `Paddle` Class
- Represents the paddle in the game.
- Manages attributes such as position, dimensions, color, and movement.
- `draw()` method draws the paddle on the game surface.
- `set_vertical_velocity()` method sets the vertical velocity of the paddle.
- `move()` method moves the paddle vertically within the window boundaries.

### 4. `Ball` Class
- Represents the ball in the game.
- Manages attributes such as color, radius, center position, velocity, surface, and collision with paddles.
- `draw()` method draws the ball on the game surface.
- `move()` method moves the ball within the window boundaries and handles collisions with paddles.
- `collidepoint()` method checks if the ball collides with the left or right paddle.

### 5. Functionality
- Players can control the left paddle using the 'q' and 'a' keys.
- Players can control the right paddle using the 'p' and 'l' keys.
- The game ends when either player reaches a score of 11.
- The ball bounces off the top and bottom edges of the window.
- Scores for both players are displayed on the window.

Your code provides a basic implementation of the classic Pong game. You can further enhance it by adding features like sound effects, ball acceleration, and a more sophisticated AI opponent. Additionally, you may consider improving the code structure and adding comments for clarity and maintainability.
